# Streamlit assignment for the Simbolo's AI course.
This is to see the GINI index by country of your choice. 
Data referece from Gapminder, and restructured to be able to deploy in this format.
Original code includes for scatter plot. The code works well in google colab so I assumed that streamlit does not support for that. (anymore? or happening only in free plan?)
But streamlit is a great platform to practice. Thanks to all relavant.
